## Overview

Firstly I follow the arrange act and assert methodology in these unit tests.
Secondly this unit testing code was made possible by creating a service layer that used dependency injection. 
Allowing the service layer to be agnostic to using a database interface or a fakerepository interface.
Dependency injection allows me to create a fake repository with test members, and then pass that into the corresponding 
services contructor. 

## Execution

Finally I'll explain my reasoning behind this sample unit test. One thing I want to note is that unit tests can always be more 
exhaustive, check more cases, look for more corner cases, but the fact is we donâ€™t have infinite time, and things 
like code coverage should be taken into account.

## Sample Test Case

        [TestMethod]
        public void CanUpdateMember()
        {
            // Arrange
            List<Member> memberList = GetMemberList();
            
            Member member = new Member()
            {
                Username = "user3",
                MemberId = 6,
                InstitutionId = 1,
                Profile = new Profile()
                {
                    Email = "fakeemail@test.com",
                    ImageUrl = "\fakeimage.png",
                    Name = "Eddie",
                    Zip = "97301",
                    MemberNumber = "1234568"
                }
            };

            FakeRepository<Member> repository = new FakeRepository<Member>(memberList);

            MemberService service = new MemberService(repository);

            //Act
            Member returnedMember = service.Update(member);

            //Assert
            Assert.AreEqual(returnedMember, member);
        }
